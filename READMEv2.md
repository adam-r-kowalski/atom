# Neuron Programming Language

Neuron is a statically typed, high-performance programming language designed for machine learning and high-performance computing. It compiles to WebAssembly, allowing your code to run anywhere WebAssembly is supported, including web browsers and server environments.

## Getting Started

### Installation

Before installing Neuron, please ensure that you have installed [Zig](https://ziglang.org/) and [Wasmer](https://wasmer.io/). Zig is a fast and reliable language that we've used to develop Neuron's compiler, and Wasmer is the WebAssembly runtime that Neuron relies on for executing your code.

Once you have Zig and Wasmer installed, you can proceed to install Neuron using the instructions provided in our installation guide.

### Your first Neuron program

Neuron has a straightforward syntax that is easy to read and write. Here is a simple Neuron program that defines a function to calculate the square of a number:

```neuron
square = fn(x: i32) i32 { x^2 }

test "function calls" {
    assert(square(1) == 1)
    assert(square(2) == 4)
    assert(square(3) == 9)
}
```

This program defines a function `square` and a set of tests to verify its behavior.

## Basic Constructs

### Functions

In Neuron, you define a function using the `fn` keyword, followed by a list of parameters and their types, the return type, and then the function body.

```neuron
max = fn(x: i32, y: i32) i32 {
    if x > y { x } else { y }
}
```

This is a function `max` that takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, and returns the greater of the two.

### Control Structures

Neuron supports conditional logic with `if` and `else` expressions. You can use the multi-arm version of `if` for chained conditionals.

```neuron
clamp = fn(value: i32, low: i32, high: i32) i32 {
    if {
        value < low { low }
        value > high { high }
        else { value }
    }
}
```

This `clamp` function ensures that a value stays within a specific range.

### Interfaces and Implementations

Interfaces in Neuron define a contract that types can implement. You can use these interfaces to write code that works with different types in a uniform way.

```neuron
Eq = interface[T] {
    (==): fn(x: T, y: T) bool
}

Ord = interface[T: Eq] {
    (<): fn(x: T, y: T) bool
    (>): fn(x: T, y: T) bool
}
```

In the code above, the `Eq` interface defines an equality operation, and `Ord` defines ordering operations. The `Ord` interface includes a constraint that its type parameter `T` must implement `Eq`.

### Foreign Function Interface

Neuron supports importing and exporting functions from the host environment.

```neuron
# Import a function from the host
log = foreign_import("console", "log", fn(x: str) void)

# Export a function to the host
foreign_export("double", fn(x: i32) i32 { x * 2 })
```

In this example, the `log` function is imported from the host's console, and the `double` function is exported for use by the host.

### Built-in Data Structures and Algorithms

Neuron includes built-in support for arrays and powerful operations over them.

```neuron
# Create an array
xs = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

# Compute the sum of an array
sum = fn(xs: i32[]) i32 { fold(xs, 0, +) }
```

Here, `xs` is an array of integers, and `sum` is a function that computes the sum of an array by folding over it.

### High-Performance Computing

Neuron provides powerful constructs for high-performance computing, like parallel fold and Einstein summation notation.

```neuron
# Compute the dot product of two vectors
dot = fn[T: Num, n: u64](a: T[n], b: T[n]) T {
    sum(for i { a[i] \* b[i] })
}

# Perform matrix multiplication
matmul = fn[T: Num, m: u64, n: u64, p: u64](a: T[m][n], b: T[n][p]) T[m][p] {
    for i, j, k { sum(a[i][k] \* b[k][j]) }
}
```

### Machine Learning

Neuron is designed with machine learning in mind. Here is a simple linear model implemented in Neuron:

```neuron
Linear = struct {
    weight: f64
    bias: f64
}

predict = fn[n: u64]({weight, bias}: Linear, x: f64[n]) -> f64[n] {
    for i { weight \* x[i] + bias }
}

sse = fn[n: u64](model: Linear, x: f64[n], y: f64[n]) f64 {
    y_hat = model.predict(x)
    sum(for i { (y_hat[i] - y[i]) ^ 2 })
}
```

## Community

Neuron is open-source and community-driven. We welcome contributions of any kind: code, documentation, design, etc. Join our community and help us make Neuron the best language for machine learning and high-performance computing!

I hope this gives you a good starting point! It's a simple introduction to Neuron and some of its features. As your language grows, you'll likely need to expand this documentation to cover more topics and provide more detail.
